# Crack Spalling Segmentation Dataset

## Overview
This dataset combines multiple existing crack and segmentation datasets (crack-seg, HRCDS, S2DS, CrSpEE) with newly collected field data and AI-generated synthetic samples. All annotations are formatted for YOLO-seg instance segmentation.

## Dataset Sources
- **Public Datasets**: 
  - [crack-seg](https://universe.roboflow.com/university-bswxt/crack-bphdr) 
  - [HRCDS](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6x4dzzrs2h/1)  
  - [S2DS](https://github.com/ben-z-original/s2ds)
  - [CrSpEE](https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/CrSpEE/)
- **Self-collected Data**: Field images from real infrastructure
- **AI-generated Data**: Synthetic crack/spalling images

## Format
YOLO-seg (instance segmentation format)
